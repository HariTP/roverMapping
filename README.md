This repository contains the Python program files for a rover mapping project. It consists of two main files:

1. `rover_mapping.py`: This file contains the main code for performing the required task. It includes functions and logic to control robotic rovers deployed on a plateau on the Moon, allowing them to navigate and send back terrain data to Earth.

2. `test_rover_mapping.py`: This file contains unit test cases for the `rover_mapping.py` file. These tests ensure that the code functions correctly and meets the specified requirements. 

## Instructions

To run the program and execute the unit tests:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned directory.
4. Run the command `python test_rover_mapping.py` to execute the unit tests.
5. Review the output to ensure all tests pass successfully.
